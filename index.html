		<h2>Roles</h2>
		<h6 class="intro">Below are some of the takes/roles I undertook during my internship </h6>
		<p class="card">I had to debug the programs during the validation and verification phase. I assisted by stepping through the codes and reporting abnormalities. Hence, I validated the programs and confirmed readiness to ship after performing release tests and deployment
			simulations</p>
		<p class="card"> I refactor 3 critical software to make them autonomous and functional in their disaster recovery site. Hence, I integrated code that detects the softwareâ€™s environment and configures the applications accordingly. Therefore the software could function
			regardless of its host server's location</p>
		<p class="card"> I study a java based open source software, gather intel from prospective users and then set up/ customize the software on the server to revamp a core service in the company.</p>
		<p class="card"> I had the task of assisting the systems administrators in expanding the office networks. I assisted by setting up multiple end devices and troubleshooting exist devices in multiple office spaces</p>
